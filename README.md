# Chainforger
A proxy scraper for proxychains

~~NO LONGER MAINTAINED. ChainForger was a nice little side project. I haven't touched it in years and don't plan to anymore, which is why it's archived now.~~

If you clone from this repo I will try to maintain, since the script is very basic and still works beautifully after not being touched in four years.
